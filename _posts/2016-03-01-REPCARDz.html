						<p class="dark font3 wow fadeInDown">My client approached me to design a mobile-first web application that would allow healthcare providers to easily connect with and find medical sales professionals. The inital part of the research centered around understanding all the different touchpoints that healthcare providers at hospitals and private medical practices have with medical sales reps. I spent nearly a year between conducting research, wireframing, UI design, prototyping, creating a design language and a development plan and roadmap for a web application aiming to connect health professionals.  </p>

						<h3>Defining the challenge</h3>
						<div class="project-subline color2-bg wow fadeInDown add-top-quarter"></div>
						<p class="dark font3 wow fadeInDown">Finding the right medical sales rep for a specific product by healthcare providers, particularly in emergency situations, is very critical. In most hospitals, there is no tool or profess for findign reps outside of having their business card handy and calling them. That in itself might not necessary warrent an entire application and interface, so it was important to understand the interactions that happen between healthcare providers and reps, what the user goals for each groups are and then extract the pain points in those interactions. The conclusiona: (1) providers need a streamlined process to find medical products and the respective rep for each all in one place, (2) medical sales reps need a more efficient way to market themselves and the products they rep to health providers all in one place. </p>
						<hr>
						<h3> Designing the solution</h3>
						<div class="project-subline color2-bg wow fadeInDown add-top-quarter"></div>
						<p class="dark font3 wow fadeInDown"> The constant between both user groups is medical products, with each user group having different goals in regards to the products. The two user groups also exist in a common system, in order to maximize the effectiveness of the tool, it was important to have a large network of users on the same platform but with different vantage points that speak to the user's goals - a provider's view and a rep's view. Designing the product for both user groups to be on the same platform would allow the client to learn more from the behaviors of both, and this is ultimately what would make the platform valuable to both user groups.</p>
						<p class="dark font3 wow fadeInDown"> The end product was two prototypes, for mobile and desktop, each with 91 screens to illustrate the user flow within the application. I paid extra attention to make the application light both in information and design scheme to establish clarity and make it as easy as possible for users to consume only information that was necessary. You can see the interactive prototypes for mobile and desktop below or scroll through the slides up top to see some screen grabs of the application that is currently in development.</p>
