						<p class="dark font3 wow fadeInDown">I spent nearly a year between conducting research, wireframing, UI design, prototyping, creating a design language and a development plan and roadmap for a web application aiming to connect health professionals. The problem we were trying to solve is the complicated process of finding the proper medical sales rep for a specific product by healthcare providers, which in emergency situations can be critical.</p>
						<p class="dark font3 wow fadeInDown">My client approached me to design a mobile-first web application that would allow healthcare providers to easily connect with and find medical sales professionals. The inital part of the research centered around understanding all the different touchpoints that healthcare providers at hospitals and private medical practices have with medical sales reps. This was followed by extracting out paint points at each of those interactions. This was helpful in making it clear that the two user segments, providers and reps had slightly different vantage points in these interactions, as a result, we needed to design and create an application that handled the user slightly different depending on which segment they fit into since providers and reps were looking to accomplish different goals.</p>
						<p class="dark font3 wow fadeInDown"> Tne one obvious constant between providers and reps was the fact that their interactions centered around medical products, one buying and the other selling. Providers need a simpler and more streamlined way to find a product and immediately know who the rep for that product is. On the other hand, reps want to be more easily reached by current and prospective customers. While taking into account those two user goals, I focused on designing the application around product searchability. Reps can easily find products that they're the rep for, and providers can find products by looking up reps or vice versa.</p>
