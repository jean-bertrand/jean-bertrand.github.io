						<div class="project-subline color-bg wow fadeInDown add-top-quarter"></div>
						<p class="dark font3 wow fadeInDown">To freshen up the look and feel of the look of the app, we removed a lot of heavy textures and woods from the App as part of a design refresh that was first released in time for iOS 9. I was asked to design a cleaner and brighter icon for the app to go along with the new look and feel of the app. I packaged new design for possible icon sizes for iOS and Android to make a super easy hand off to our mobile developers.</p>

						<div class="project-subline color-bg wow fadeInDown add-top-quarter"></div>
						<p class="dark font3 wow fadeInDown">In an effort to save money by not printing a holiday gift guide as Whole Foods Market has traditionally done, the company and regions still wanted a way to be able to promote holiday gifts and partnerships that would be available in store for the holidays. I was asked to come up with a concept to replace the traditional printed guide that was interactive, fun but met business objectives in promoting available gifts at Whole Foods Market stores through out all its regions. I came up with a concept similar to advent calendar where instead, each day for 30 days leading up to christmas, we would auto-publish a gift. I prototyped, designed and developed a simple and light solution that fit with the existing larger holiday guide that was already in place.  </p><br/>
