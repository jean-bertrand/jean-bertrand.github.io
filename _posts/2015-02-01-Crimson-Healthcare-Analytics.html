							<h3>Defining the problem</h3>
							<div class="project-subline color2-bg wow fadeInDown add-top-quarter"></div>
							<p class="dark font3 wow fadeInDown">This client handles massive amounts of very sensitive data and it can be very challenging for analysts to gather the status of data loads from their client organizations. The challenge was creating a solution that allowed both internal and external stakeholders to understand the status of data loads. Since some tools don't work properly without certain data files having been uploaded and properly uploaded, we needed to not just communicate status but importance, detail and required action as well. </p>

							<h3>Designing the solution</h3>
							<div class="project-subline color2-bg wow fadeInDown add-top-quarter"></div>
							<p class="dark font3 wow fadeInDown">In order to design an solution that was truly usel, it was clear early on that it needed to be simple and easily digestable for interal and external stakeholders. The client had defined what was needed to be conveyed from a data and information perspective, this was important for me to udnerestand thoroughly in order to design an interface that would solve the problem most effeciently. Since we knew the information that needed to be communicated, we had to prioritize what was most important, what was critical, and what was just simply a 'good to have'. Giving information at a glance was helpful but what would truly solve the problem would be attaching action items to that information, and also allowing users on both ends to take a deeper dive into each file.</p>
